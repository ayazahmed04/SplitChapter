# PDF Chapter Extractor

## Overview
The **PDF Chapter Extractor** is a Python web application that allows users to extract chapters from PDF files. Users can upload a PDF file via a drag-and-drop interface or file upload, and the application identifies and extracts chapters based on headings or specific patterns.

---

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Users can drag and drop PDF files for easy uploads.
- **File Upload Support**: Fallback option for selecting files manually.
- **Chapter Extraction**: Extracts chapters based on headings (e.g., "Chapter 1").
- **Interactive UI**: Displays extracted chapters in a user-friendly format.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**:
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): Lightweight web framework for Python.
  - [pdfplumber](https://pypi.org/project/pdfplumber/): Library for extracting text from PDF files.
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5, CSS3
  - JavaScript (for drag-and-drop functionality)
- **Other**:
  - Python standard libraries: `os` for file handling.

## How to Use
1. **Upload a PDF**:
   - Drag and drop the file into the designated area, or click "Choose File" to select a PDF.
2. **Extract Chapters**:
   - The app processes the file and identifies chapters based on headings like "Chapter X".
3. **View Results**:
   - Extracted chapters are displayed on the webpage.

---

## Customization
- **Chapter Detection Logic**:
  Modify the `extract_chapters` function in `app.py` to adjust how chapters are identified. For example, you can use regex for more complex patterns.
- **Styling**:
  Update the `styles.css` file in the `static/` directory to change the UI appearance.

---

## Known Issues
- Inconsistent results for PDFs with complex layouts or non-standard chapter headings.
- Large PDFs may take longer to process.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multilingual chapter detection.
- Enhance chapter identification with NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK).
- Allow users to download extracted chapters as separate files.
